For next week :
- create a dataset : 
Download in data/raw color videos from 'youtube8m' dataset
Convert them to same length, same resolution, same fps BW videos
~ 100 examples at first

- try some existing github implementation of 'Image Colorization'
Agree on the one to use

- try this implementation frame by frame on the examples
(Baseline)

For the following weeks:
- try the optimization propagation
- try the GAN color propagation (cycle GAN : see paper from TA)
